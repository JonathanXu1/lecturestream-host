# Lecture Streamer (Unfinished)

This was a project developed for YHack 2019.

Lecture Streamer combines Python-based OpenCV for motion tracking with
an Arduino in order to track a professor moving around a lecture hall.
Then, this video feed would be streamed with Flask to a web portal with
Firebase authentication.

This is the OpenCV/Arduino portion of the project.
